The government is not listening to anyone, including the farmers who are on the roads for the past nine months, Mufti added.\n",

We have a lot of issues, the biggest being the farmers' protest and the issues of the people of Jammu and Kashmir which was bifurcated, rampant corruption and the lack of development. \"They are claiming that Article 370 was removed for parity but even tenders for our minor minerals and jobs are given to outsiders. Taliban is there but let's talk about our issues as the BJP has made the condition of the people of our country so miserable that they are not even able to buy ration,\" she told reporters in Poonch, where she reached on the first leg of her over a week-long tour of Jammu region. \n",

    "\n",
    "The comment led to criticism by sections of the media as well as on social media platforms.\n",

My stand is clear that I will continue my struggle for restoration of the prestige, identity and rights of our people which were snatched from us unconstitutionally. I will continue to work to seek a solution to the Kashmir problem so that bloodshed is stopped.\"\n",
